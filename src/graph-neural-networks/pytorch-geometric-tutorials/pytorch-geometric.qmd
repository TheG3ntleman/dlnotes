# Applying classical deep learning techniques to graph based data
Every graph can be represented as an adjacency matrix and there already exist a wide variety of architectures in deep learning which act primarily on matrices primarily those related to image processing. However, passing the adjacency matrix of a graph as input to a deep neural network is a bad idea for a variety of reasons:
-
